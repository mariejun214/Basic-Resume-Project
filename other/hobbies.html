<p>In my life, I have a bunch of things I really enjoy. First off, <br>
    I love teaching computer stuff. It's not just a job to me; <br>
    it's something I'm super passionate about. I like making the <br>
    learning experience exciting and am always eager to find out <br>
    more about computers.</p>

 <p> Now, here's a fun fact about me, I'm also a magician! What <br>
    started as a cool hobby turned into a job where I got to <br>
    entertain people with magic tricks. It's awesome to bring a <br>
    bit of wonder into people's lives.</p>  
    
  <p>Besides all the tech and magic, I'm really into music. I play <br>
    the guitar, and it's a great way for me to express myself. <br>
    Music has this cool way of connecting with emotions, and I <br>
    love that. And, of course, there's my love for gaming. I <br>
    enjoy playing computer games, both on my PC and my phone. <br>
    It's a fantastic escape, diving into these virtual worlds <br>
    and having adventures.</p>  
     
    
   <p>Basically, whether it's teaching, doing magic, strumming my <br>
    guitar, or diving into video games, each of these things is <br>
    like a window into who I am. They make life exciting and full <br>
    of joy!</p>
